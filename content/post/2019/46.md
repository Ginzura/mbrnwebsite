The morning leg of the Freshers' day programme was a series of fun & games organized by the third years. It was an effort to enliven the freshers and acclimatize them to their beautiful home of Brindavan. The evening programme was an exploration of talents by the freshers ranging from flute recitals to instrumental renditions and an impactful drama presentation.
