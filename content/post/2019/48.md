The Independence day was a packed event organized by the sophomores that was filled with games  testing the brain. In the evening, the students presented a heart moving drama on the life of five patriots who went by the alias 'Panch Pandavas' and martyred themselves for the nation. It roused the patriotic vibes and brought tears to the eyes of many.
