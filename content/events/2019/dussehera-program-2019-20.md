The Dussehera is an unforgettable experience for any Sai student. The holy Veda Purusha saptaha gyana yagna and the prashanti vidwan mahasabha is nothing less than a spiritual treat and is an experience that lingers throughout. Some interested seekers also do a reading of the Devi Mahatyam after undergoing several preliminary rites.
