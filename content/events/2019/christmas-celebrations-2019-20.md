A tete-a-tete with Santa was not too much to ask for. The Christmas programme began with a lively chat hosted by a plump and charming Santa. It was a session filled with laughter interspersed with tiny powerful messages. This was followed by a rendition of the Christmas Carols,a must-have for any Christmas celebration.
