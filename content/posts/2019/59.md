The skit competition began with the Arjunas presenting a humorous play with the cast led by an old, energetic septuagenarian who was the harbinger of a powerful message. Following this was the skit by the Bharathas who weaved a story with the theme-"If you can't change your fate, change your attitude". The judges, after a tough time evaluating declared the Bharatas as the winners.
