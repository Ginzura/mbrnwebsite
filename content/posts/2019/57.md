desc_short: Music transports you to a state of 'nothing' & that's everything you need from it. Getting lost can be a pleasurable experience  especially when the maze is synchronized beats & mellifluous melodies.

The two houses- Bharathas and Arjunas each presented a 15 minutes well stitched musical presentation. The Arjunas began with touching pieces hovering around the theme of "A musical story on Chandrayaan-2".The Bharatas' was an amalgam of various symphonies reverberating with the flavours of Indian festivals. Eventually, the Arjunas blew the trumpet in celebration.
