desc_short: Clarity is never got by a single chain of thought, but by constantly ruling out superfluous threads & emerging with refined opinions. The battle of wits- the Annual Debate competition was a power packed contest of well built arguments & juxtapositions.

"Capital punishment must be abolished" was the topic that was debated on by the two houses. The Arjunas moved the motion & the Bharatas were against the motion. Five debaters from each of the houses presented a barrage of reasons supporting their opinion. The Bharatas were adjudicated as the winners of the Debate competition.
