Being on the hill view stadium on the 11th of January is an exhilarating experience. The Brindavan campus had taken the viewers to the green fields of Kerala with the traditional martial arts form-'Kalaripayattu'. Following this was a blistering performance by the sumos who had quite a flair with their agile gymnastics quite betraying their sizes. The hipsters then left the audience in a daze with their body twisting dance moves. 
On the 13th was a drama presentation on the life of Sant Namdev which epitomized the ideal of Divine kinship.
